`pyproject.toml` is a new configuration file defined in
[PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/). It is design to store
build system requirements, but it can also store any tool configuration for your
Python project, possibly replacing the need for `setup.cfg` or other
tool-specific files.

- [PEP 518 file specification](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/#specification).

We think `pyproject.toml` is pretty awesome, so this
[awesome list](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list) contains projects already
using it, or discussing its inclusion.

Do you know of any other project not included here? Please
